\section{General Information}

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to outline the testing methodologies that will
be used to test the Spann Web IDE application to ensure the application
functions are specified in the software requirements specification document and
to reveal possible bugs in the application.

\subsection{Scope}
The scope of the testing will be the front end JavaScript UI code and the back
end C\# code and SQL queries, as well as the API responses from the server.

\subsection{Overview of Document}
This document will outline the testing methodologies and various test plans
that the development team will incorporate and use to test the application.

\section{Plan}
	
\subsection{Software Description}
The software, for which the test plan is being written, is an online, web-based,
IDE. The final application will be similar to a
desktop IDE that many developers are familiar with. The application will have
two parts, a front end that will be written in JavaScript and LESS (transpiled
into CSS), and a back end server written in C\# (which uses a SQL server for
persistent data storage).

\subsection{Test Team}
The test team will be made up of Christopher Stokes and Varun Hooda.

\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}

\subsection{Testing Tools}
For the server NUint will be used for unit testing the C\# code.
For the front end we will be using jasmine (a NodeJS module) for unit testing
the JavaScript UI components.
For the server API we will be using postman (a chrome web application).

\subsection{Testing Schedule}

\section{System Test Description}
	
\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\subsubsection{Front End JavaScript UI Components}
		
\paragraph{JavaScript UI Component Tests}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{Front end JavaScript UI\\}

Type: Dynamic
					
Description: The test will ensure certain properties of each UI components
hold.  Properties such as whether the component is not null, it's fields have
the required values and whether it has required functions and methods.

How test will be performed: Each UI component will have a Jasmine test file.
The Jasmine NodeJS plugin will then be used to execute the tests.
					
\end{enumerate}


\paragraph{Server API Tests}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{Login/Authentication\\}

Type: Dynamic
					
Description: This test will ensure the application is handling user login,
password, username, and authentication in general, correctly.

How test will be performed: This test will be carried out using the Postman
application and a test file written for the Postman application.

\item{Database responses\\}

Type: Dynamic
					
Description: This test will be used to test whether the server correctly
replies with the correct database data. 

How test will be performed: This test will be carried out using the Postman
application and a test file written for the Postman application.

\item{Python Execution\\}

Type: Functional
					
Description: This test will be used to test whether the server replies with a 
correct response to a python program execution. The response should be the output
of the python interpreter exactly to a given input.

How test will be performed: This test will be carried out using the Postman
application and a test file written for the Postman application.

\item{File Management\\}

Type: Functional
					
Description: The application is an IDE, so users will be able to create source
code file. This test will be used to test whether the server is able to handle
files correctly, create them, modify them, move them, delete them.

How test will be performed: This test will be carried out using the Postman
application and a test file written for the Postman application.

\item{User Account\\}

Type: Functional
					
Description: The application will also allow users to set preferences and other
account related details. This test will ensure the back end server handles user
account data correctly.

How test will be performed: This test will be carried out using the Postman
application and a test file written for the Postman application.
					
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Back End C\# Server}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{SQL Queries\\}

Type: Functional
					
Description: This test will ensure the server generates the correct database
queries once it has received a request from the front end via a web socket.

How test will be performed: This test will be performed using NUint and a test
case written in C\#.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\subsubsection{Front End JavaScript UI}
		
\paragraph{Look and Feel}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{UI visual inspection\\}

Type: Manual

Description: The purpose of this test will be to manually to inspect the application to
discover visual bug, artifacts, and any other UI imperfections.

How test will be performed: This type of testing is only possible manually,
since it is simply not possible to automatically inspect the UI using a
computer.
					
\item{UI performance\\}

Type: Manual

Description: The purpose of this test is to ensure the application's UI
is fast and responsive. This will help identify any UI performance issues.

How test will be performed: This will also be done manually since it would
be very difficult to programmatically test.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Server API}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{Account Security\\}

Type: Functional

Description: The purpose of this test is to ensure the only person able to
access a user's account is the actual user only.

How test will be performed: This test will be performed using the Postman
application and test cases written for the Postman application.
					
\item{Response Time\\}

Type: Functional

Description: The purpose of this test will be to ensure the application server
always responds to the user's requests within a justifiable time (depending on
the specific request).  For example, a login should not take more than a single
second to process. The actual python program that will be executed will be
excluded from this since it is not possible to determine the execution time
from statically analysing the python code.

How test will be performed: This test will be performed using the Postman
application and test cases written for the Postman application.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Unit Testing Plan}
		
\subsection{Unit testing of internal functions}

\subsection{C\#}
In order to test the internal functions and logic of the C\# server, the
reflective capabilities of C\# will be utilised. NUnit utilises reflection to
provide access to internal classes not normally accessible, this is necessary
as by default C\# classes are private to all but the namespace. To extend this
capability reflection will be used to access the private member properties, and
functions allowing direct calls to these elements and direct access to their
return values. This will greatly reduce the amount of mocking required to
execute the tests, and overall providing simpler tests and more rugged and
reliable test which are not easily broken. 

\subsection{JavaScript} In order to test the JavaScript modules, multiple tests
patterns will need to be used due to the nature of the code. 

The first type applies to all the custom UI components of the Spann UI engine,
where the private members are located directly in the object returned from the
module. The internal parts of the components are located in an object named
\_private on the module objects. This is a consequence of patterns used to allow
inheritance in JavaScript and lack of a dependency manager for the UI
components, increasing performance.  

In comparison, the remaining code in the Spann client uses the revealing module
pattern as well as AMD with RequireJS. This combination means a simple
management of dependencies but as a consequence, there is no way to access the
components not revealed from the module. Therefore, all modules will reveal a
method named \_getInternals which will return all the internal methods allowing
them to be tested.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the test cases will call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.

\subsection{Usability Survey Questions?}
