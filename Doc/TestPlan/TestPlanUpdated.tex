\section{General Information}

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to outline the testing methodologies that will
be used to test the Spann Web IDE application to ensure the application
functions are specified in the software requirements specification document and
to reveal possible bugs in the application.

\subsection{Scope}
The scope of the testing will be the front end JavaScript UI code and the back
end C\# code and SQL queries, as well as the API responses from the server.

\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	
				
\section{Unit Testing Plan}
		
\subsection{Unit testing of internal functions}

\subsection{C#}
In order to test the internal functions and logic of the C# server, 
the reflective capabilities of C# will be utilised. NUnit utilises 
reflection to provide access to internal classes not normally accessible, 
this is necessary as by default C# classes are private to all but the 
namespace. To extend this capability reflection will be used to access 
the private member properties, and functions allowing direct calls to these 
elements and direct access to their return values. This will greatly reduce 
the amount of mocking required to execute the tests, and overall providing 
simpler tests and more rugged and reliable test which are not easily broken. 

\subsection{JavaScript}
In order to test the JavaScript modules, multiple tests patterns will need 
to be used due to the nature of the code. 

The first type applies to all the custom UI components of the Spann UI engine, 
where the private members are located directly in the object returned from the 
module. The internal parts of the components are located in an object named 
_private on the module objects. This is a consequence of patterns used to allow 
inheritance in JavaScript and lack of a dependency manager for the UI components, 
increasing performance.  

In comparison, the remaining code in the Spann client uses the revealing module 
pattern as well as AMD with RequireJS. This combination means a simple management 
of dependencies but as a consequence, there is no way to access the components not 
revealed from the module. Therefore, all modules will reveal a method named 
_getInternals which will return all the internal methods allowing them to be tested.

\section{Appendix}

This is where you can place additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the test cases will call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.

\subsection{Usability Survey Questions?}

This is a section that would be appropriate for some teams.
