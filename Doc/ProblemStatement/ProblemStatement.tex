\textbf{What problem are you trying to solve?}\\
\normalsize

The project Spann is attempting to reduce the delays in development
caused by compiler/interpreter setup and maintenance,  IDE maintenance,
files system maintenance and dependency control. These issues are especially
noticeable on smaller projects where the delay in development is a much higher
percentage of the overall time. The project, therefore, focuses on providing a
quick and easy development environment for the user. This means lowering the
time impact of the multitude of issues that slow down development or impede
actual development tasks.\\

\large
\textbf{“Why is this an important problem?}\\
\normalsize

Development is often a challenging process that has many points of failure.
This is why developers often make use of tools and software applications that
make the entire process easier to manage and maintain, as well as reduce the
overall effort and time that has to be put in by developers. Web-based
coding/development solutions, such as the one we are basing our project on,
often lack many features and functionality that make modern software
development more efficient. Thus the benefits of such online platforms are
often outweighed by their lack of features and functionality. Solving this
issue will provide developers with the benefits of an online, web-based,
development platform while retaining the benefits of traditional desktop IDEs.
Thus increasing the efficiency of the entire software development processes.\\

\large
\textbf{What is the context of the problem you are solving?}\\
\normalsize

The primary stakeholders of Spann are developers who need to prototype or test
sections of code, and developers working on projects that makes use of not only
the language's standard library, but also additional third party modules. By
having the platform run independently of a user’s system, we’re able to make
Spann accessible to more people by removing the complexity, effort and time of
setting up a development environment. This makes it ideal for developers
working on different platforms and devices that may not support the language or
have complications with setting up the environment. It also is ideal for
developers working on subsections of a larger project, giving them the ability
to quickly implement algorithms with fewer faults away from the complications
of the larger project.\\
