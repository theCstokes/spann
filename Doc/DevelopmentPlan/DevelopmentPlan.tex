\section{Technology}
The project will use modern web technologies for the frontend: HTML5, CSS3
(compiled from LESS) and JavaScript. The backend server will run C\# code and
use the PostgreSQL object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) to
store and retrieve data. A custom JavaScript web framework will also be used to
create the frontend website (to avoid manually writing HTML).

\section{Coding Style}
ECMA5 Script Standard for JavaScript.\\
LESS Standard for LESS files\\
Microsoft Coding Conventions for C\#.
